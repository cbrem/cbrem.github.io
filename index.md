Welcome to my site!

I'm Connor, a software engineer at [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm the tech lead for the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com), a computer-adaptive English proficiency exam.

I'm a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science program. I'm interested in machine learning, linguistics, education, and tinkering with electronics.

Check out some of my projects!
