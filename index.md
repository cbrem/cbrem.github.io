Welcome to my site! I'm Connor, a software engineer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

I develop [testcenter.duolingo.com](https://testcenter.duolingo.com) for Duolingo. I'm a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science program. I'm interested in linguistics, programming languages, education, and tinkering with electronics.

Check out some of my projects!
