*OurTOS* is an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) developed for the Freescale MC9S12C128, a 16-bit microcontroller. It's very lightweight (only a few hundred lines of code!), but it provides uses with basic task scheuling and mutexes to share between those tasks.

It uses a version of the *priority ceiling* protocol to safely intermix real-time scheduling with mutexes: if a low-priority task is holding a mutex which a high-priority task wants, the lower task temporarily gains a higher priority until it is finished with the mutex.

The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/cbrem/ourtos).
