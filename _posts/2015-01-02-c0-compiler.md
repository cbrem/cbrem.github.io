title: C0 Compiler
category: Software

For Carnegie Mellon's Compilers course, I wrote a compiler for [C0](http://c0.typesafety.net/), a simple C-like language. The compiler targeted x86-64 assembly.

With optimizations enabled, it generated code that ran at about 160% of the speed of GCC. These speed tests covered a number of benchmarks with contained memory-intensive tasks like matrix multiplication.

The compiler is written in Haskell. As the class is still ongoing, the code is not public, but I can provide it on request.
