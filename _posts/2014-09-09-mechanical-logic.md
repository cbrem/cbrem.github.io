*Mechanical Logic* was an initiative to develop mechanical devices which acted as logic gates for use in education settings. Over the course of about a year and a half, the *Mechanical Logic* team and I went though a number of gate designs, participated in numerous teaching engagements and competitions, and won a few awards.

For CMU's Build18 hack week in 2013, we developed very small, LEGO-compatible version of the gates. We won the *First Penguin* award, named after a term coined by CMU's professor Randy Pausch, for a project which deviated most significantly from the theme of the electronics- and programming-themed competition.

Later, at CMU's 2013 Meeting of the Minds, we won an award from the *Studio for Creative Inquiry*, a studio in CMU's College of Fine Arts. This award went to projects which meshed disciplines: in our case, the disciplines of electrical engineering, industrial design, and education.

Since late 2012, the *Mechanical Logic* team has worked with the University of Pittsburgh and CMU to deploy the gates and an associated curriculum at a number of events. We've worked with *TechNights* and *ECE Outreach* at CMU and *Scientists, Mathematicians, And Engineers For Service* at Pitt. We've also worked on our own to each lessons at *Mt. Lebanon High School* in Pittsburgh, PA.

Our project blog (which has been inactive as of late) is [here](http://mechalogic.wordpress.com).
