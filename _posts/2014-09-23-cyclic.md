*Cyclic* is a bike-mounted instrument that plays as a rider pedals. It's structured like a harp, and strung like a guitar.

The rider has little control over the pitches that it plays. Rather, it amplifies their normal riding motions into music.

*Cyclic* was created a part of a course called *Hybrid Instruments*. More information and pictures are [here](http://teach.alimomeni.net/2014fall2/?p=4482).
