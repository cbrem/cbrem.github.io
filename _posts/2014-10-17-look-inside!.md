*What happens if I look inside?*

Curiosity is a powerful force. *Look Inside!* investigates how people react when presented with a non-descript box and an offer to look inside.

If people choose to peer inside the box, they find a mechanical drum set, which begins to play a simple but incessant beat. The beat grows in speed and intensity, and the box begins to shake!

At this point, people interacting with the piece have a choice: back away and attempt to dissociate themselves from the commotion theyâ€™ve caused, or keep watching. When Look Inside! was displayed, some people ran, and some stayed. Some even came back to play again.

The piece is powered by a Raspberry Pi running a Python script. It uses rotary solenoids to play its instruments.

*Look Inside!* explores curiosity, responsibility, and control. Would you look inside?
