*Edugamify* is an online educational game developed for for CMU's philanthropic TechBrigde organization as part of their [TechCaFE](http://www.techbridgeworld.org/programs/techcafe.html) program.

It allows students to design and trade educational mini-games. These games are populated with multiple-choice questions provided by an instructor. In our prototype, we used questions that teach English.

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/elpintar/edugamify).
