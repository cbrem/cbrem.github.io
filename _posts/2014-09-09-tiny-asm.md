*TinyASM* is an online tool which allows students to write, run, and visualize programs in a simple assembly language. It's intended for middle- and high-school students learning about assembly and processers. It's intentionally very simple, and it's great for students who have little programming background.

I designed *TinyASM* for a presentation that I gave at *TechNights*, a CMU program which teaches middle-school girls about technology. Since then, I've also deployed it at *ECE Outreach*, a CMU program for high-schoolers.

The source is available on [Github](https://github.com/cbrem/tiny-asm). And it's currently deployed [here](/tiny-asm/).
