*Beacon* is a smart bike glove that makes you safer on the road. It signals with you: when you raise your hand to signal a left turn, it illuminates a left-facing arrow; when you signal a right turn, it illuminates a right-facing arrow. It makes cycling hand signals less ambiguous to cars, and looks great too!
