For the past two and a half years, I've been a Course Assistant for 15-112, an intro computer science course at Carnegie Mellon. The course is taught in Python. It covers the basics of programming, including constructs like loops, conditionals, and funcitons, objects, and recursion, and some computer science topics like efficiency analysis.

It's quite fast-paced and difficult for an introductory course, and has a "learn-by-doing" ideology. It also has a project component: at the end of the semester, students produce a project of their own design using what they've learned. Some are quite stunning! A few are documented [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/gallery.html).

As a Course Assistant, I lecture and tutor a few times each week. I also advise about a dozen end-of-semester project each semester. I'm proud to say that there have been some very cool ones in the bunch!

The course site is available [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112).
