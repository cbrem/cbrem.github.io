Between Spring 2015 and Spring 2016, I developed and taught an introductory coding course for middle schoolers at the [Propel East](http://www.propelschools.org/propel-east/) school in East Pittsburgh. Propel East is one of a network of charter schools in underserved communities in Pittsburgh.

In my course, I taught around a dozen students the basics of programming using Processing and Python. We went from zero to a game of Pong in just 10 classes!
