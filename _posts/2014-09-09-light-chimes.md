*Light Chimes* is a instrument which keeps the form of a wind chime while changing the function.

Each string dangling below the body of the chime is attached to a capsule, which opens or closes based on the string's position. A microcontroller in the chime's weight regularly reads the light intensity in the capsules, and places a pitch based on these readings. The result is a persistent, hollow, electronic melody.

*Light Chimes* was created as part of a course at CMU. There's more info on the course page [here](http://teach.alimomeni.net/2014fall2/?p=3955).
